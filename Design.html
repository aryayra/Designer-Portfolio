        First of all, he reflected on the nature of design and designers, and believed that this part that should be
        free should not become a "fixed model" in the Japanese design industry. So he came to the outside world to
        search and came to China. He brought together the price bubble boards of vendors, neon lights in large and small
        markets, and small advertisements posted everywhere as inspiration for the design. He fell in love with the
        packaging of Coconut Tree brand coconut juice at first
        sight and thought it was the best design.

        That is what Yui Takada considers to be "the most refreshing and unfettered design in the world" and "a freer
        graphic design." Their existence does not follow the rules, but the most essential purpose is to convey
        information to people, use every available resource to present as much information as possible, and provide
        people with corresponding convenience at a certain moment. But these may be out of touch with aesthetics and
        cheap. Who would fall in love with foam boards, neon lights, small advertisements and the packaging of coconut
        brand coconut juice without hesitation. "The industry doesn't pay much attention to street signs. They ignore
        the rules and are more exciting." He believes that this is a deliberate change in design ideas, which goes
        against Japanese design concepts, but it has never been designed casually. He is sincerely dedicated to these
        Fascinated by things, all his designs began to be inspired by
        real life, and he never tired of it.

        He began to connect the wonderful relationship between "design" and "information", and presented it to people eye-catchingly with the "playfulness" and "joy" he could express. "I want to take off those models and see if there are more (design) directions." "Looking back at Japanese design, I feel that designers' works are too regular and have too many rules, making them less interesting."

        Yui Takada uses his own efforts and methods to 
        make boring designs come alive.
