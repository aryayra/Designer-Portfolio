              Takada Yui said: This is the poster for my personal exhibition. In a place like Japan, where you can see beautiful designs everywhere, the elements I used seemed a little out of place with the 
              surrounding environment, right?
      
            </p>

              The poster is divided into three parts from top to bottom, and deliberately uses blurry photos, coupled with difficult-to-recognize graphic text and strange facial graphics. The entire poster has an indescribable sense of dissonance.
