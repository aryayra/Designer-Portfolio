          <h6>Personal Exhibition <br>
            "A FLOWER A DAY"
            </h6>
          <p>
            The second personal exhibition was at the gallery of Mr. Lu Jingren, whom Takada Yui admired very much. Mr. Lu Jingren once worked for the outstanding graphic designer Sugiura Kohei in Japan. He has been an ardent fan of Mr. Sugiura Kohei since he was a student. He is always impressed by the design with a large amount of information and admires it very much. The exhibition in Beijing was designed mainly with the new work "Painting of Flowers (One Flower a Day)". Yui Takada wanted to place real flowers at the venue, and it would be fun to have everyone go to the flower market together. He really enjoys participating in this kind of improvisation-like
             activity that can only be done locally.
