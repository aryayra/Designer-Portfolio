        Personal Exhibition  <br>
        "Diving Graphic"

      </h6>
      <p>
        A memorable first solo exhibition in China! The posters and flyers displayed at the exhibition are in the shape of a spoof motorcycle fender. This may not be unusual to everyone, but Takada Yui felt it was very fresh, "It can only be this!" Takada Yui thought while happily designing. He not only absorbed the essence of Japanese street design, but also studied our Chinese street design. He took a lot of photos with his camera on the streets of Shanghai. Yui Takada said: These creative ideas make me very interesting, because this is a scenery that is completely invisible in Japan. The inspiration for the "Diving Exhibition" poster came from this. This poster has also caused considerable controversy. Some people say that "designers" who work in print shops can make such a poster. Some people even suspect that the poster is not from Takada Yui's hand, but is just a curatorial method. It's just a poor imitation of Takada Yui's style. In order to dispel doubts, Takada Yui's "response" was to place an electric car at the entrance of the exhibition site, and the fender behind the car was replaced by an exhibition poster, because the shape of the poster and the fender are exactly the same. . As mentioned before, the poster was inspired by the
         fenders on the rear of electric vehicles.
